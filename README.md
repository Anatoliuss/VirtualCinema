Virtual Reality cinema room
This program allows to enter a virtual environment, simulating living room.
You will see avatars around you - those are NPC's, programmed for imitating real people
Press "movie1", "movie2" or "movie3" for choosing a movie (it will appear in the front of the room), press a pause/play button to pause or continue it
You should press with your floating hands - those are the hands for interaction. You can move them either with real movements or with a joystick
In the next update, multiplayer option will be added, allowing to connect to other people and seeing them - stay tuned for updates!
